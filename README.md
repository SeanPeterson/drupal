# drupal
barebones drupal theme

As I've been primarily a WordPress developer, this was the first Drupal project that I've attempted. The first step was poring over various Drupal tutorials online and YouTube, although I primarily used the official Drupal documentation. I'm utilizing npm in this project which I used download the gulp file to compile my sass. 

As I am using SASS, it is extremly easy to change variables such as the colour scheme, margins, etc.



# Note
-To my eye the cololurs were a bit different from the Photoshop file versus the invision mockup. As I wasn't sure which was correct I just went with the Photoshop version. The as I'm using for this in the sass settings.scss file this would be super easy to change ($primary-color).
-I was also not able to match the fonts exactly, as the ones used are paid fonts. Again, this would be quick to remedy in sass.
